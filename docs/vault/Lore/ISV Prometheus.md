# ISV Prometheus

The **Interstellar Vessel Prometheus** is a generation ship — a self-contained world hurtling through the void between stars. Launched from the Sol system in 2187, it carries the largest single-vessel colonization effort in human history.

## Ship Details
- **Class**: Generation / Colony ship
- **Registry**: ISV (Interstellar Vessel) — United Nations Interstellar Authority
- **Hull**: Cylindrical, ~400m long × 65m beam, rotating habitat section
- **Mission**: Establish a human colony at destination system
- **Crew complement**: ~100–1,000 active crew (varies by mission config)
- **Passenger manifest**: ~2,000–5,000+ colonists
- **Voyage duration**: Decades to centuries depending on destination and propulsion

## Origin Story

### The Push Factors
By the mid-22nd century, Earth faced a convergence of crises that made interstellar colonization not just aspirational but necessary:

- **Climate collapse** had rendered large regions uninhabitable. The Mediterranean had become desert; Southeast Asia was largely underwater.
- **Resource depletion** — rare earth minerals, helium-3, and clean water were in permanent deficit. Asteroid mining had eased some pressure but couldn't keep up with 11 billion people.
- **Political fragmentation** — the old nation-state system had splintered into competing blocs. The United Nations, reformed as the **UN Interstellar Authority (UNIA)**, was one of the few remaining cooperative institutions.
- **Technological readiness** — fusion power, closed-loop life support, and cryogenic food storage had matured enough to make multi-decade voyages survivable, if not comfortable.

### The Prometheus Program
In 2171, UNIA announced the **Prometheus Program** — a fleet of generation ships, each bound for a different star system. The program was funded through a global bond program backed by asteroid mining revenues. The ISV Prometheus was the second ship completed, after the ISV Daedalus (bound for Proxima Centauri).

### Who Goes?
Colonist selection was controversial. UNIA used a lottery system weighted by:
- **Skills** (priority for engineers, doctors, farmers, teachers)
- **Genetic diversity** (minimum 160 unrelated founding lineages)
- **Age** (18–45, to maximize reproductive years)
- **Health** (no chronic conditions that would burden limited medical systems)
- **Willingness** (surprisingly, many lottery winners declined — leaving forever is hard)

Crew were selected from military and merchant marine personnel, with additional specialists (botanists, geologists, psychologists) recruited specifically for the mission.

## Governance

### The Charter
Before departure, all colonists and crew signed the **Prometheus Charter**, a constitutional document establishing:

- **Civilian Council**: 12 elected representatives from the passenger body, serving 4-year terms. Handles colony law, resource allocation disputes, education policy, and cultural affairs.
- **Ship Command**: Military hierarchy led by the Captain, responsible for ship operations, navigation, defense, and emergency response. Command authority supersedes Council during declared emergencies.
- **Arbitration Board**: 3 members (1 Command, 1 Council, 1 rotating civilian) that resolves disputes between the two branches.
- **Ship's Constitution**: Bill of rights including freedom of speech, right to fair resource allocation, right to vote, and prohibition of hereditary rank.

### The Captain
The Captain holds ultimate authority over ship safety but is bound by the Charter in peacetime governance. Historically, captains have ranged from benevolent leaders to authoritarian figures, depending on the pressures they faced. The current Captain was selected by UNIA before departure and serves for life (or until medically incapacitated).

### Factions
Over the decades, political factions have emerged:

- **Foundationists**: Believe the ship should maintain Earth traditions, governance, and culture. Tend to support strong Command authority.
- **Voyagers**: Embrace ship-born identity. Want to develop new traditions suited to life in space. Push for more Council power.
- **Pragmatists**: Centrist faction focused on resource efficiency and survival. Large but less vocal.
- **Returners** (minority): Believe the mission was a mistake and advocate for turning back or finding a closer destination. Increasingly marginalized as distance from Sol grows.

## Culture

### Daily Life
Life aboard is structured around the **three-shift system** (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), each covering 8 hours. The ship never sleeps — there's always a third of the population awake and working. Off-duty hours are spent in recreation, education, or personal pursuits.

### Traditions
- **Launch Day** (annually): Commemorates departure from Sol. Speeches, a memorial for those left behind, and a feast using reserve rations.
- **Midpoint Ceremony**: Celebrated when the ship reaches the halfway point of the voyage. Traditionally marks the moment when "we are closer to our new home than our old one."
- **Naming Day**: Children born aboard are given names at a public ceremony at 30 days old. The community witnesses and the child is entered into the Ship's Register.
- **The Watch**: A rotating vigil at the observation lounge where volunteers sit in silence and look at the stars. Originally practical (watching for hazards), now a meditative tradition.

### Generational Shifts
On longer voyages, the ship's culture drifts significantly:
- **Generation 1** (launch generation): Remember Earth, carry grief and purpose.
- **Generation 2** (ship-born, Earth-raised parents): Caught between two worlds. Often the most politically active.
- **Generation 3+** (fully ship-born): Consider the ship their homeland. Earth is abstract history. Tend toward Voyager faction politics.

### Art and Expression
With limited physical space, art tends toward the ephemeral: music, storytelling, dance, digital art projected on bulkheads. The ship maintains a small physical library of books selected before departure, treated as sacred artifacts. The Theatre hosts weekly performances — ranging from Shakespeare to original works written aboard.

## Historical Events (Voyage Timeline)

### Year 0 — Launch
Departure from Earth-Sun L2 point. Tearful farewells broadcast to Earth. Last real-time communication with Sol.

### Year 3 — The Schism
First major political crisis. A faction led by Engineer Reyes demanded the ship divert to a closer system. The Captain invoked emergency authority. Reyes was confined to quarters. The incident led to the first amendment to the Charter, establishing formal dissent procedures.

### Year 12 — The Bloom
A contamination event in Hydroponics Bay 3 led to an algae bloom that temporarily overwhelmed atmosphere processing. Two decks were sealed for 6 days. No deaths, but it exposed vulnerabilities in the closed-loop ecosystem. Led to redundant HVAC systems and the creation of the Environmental Watch department.

### Year 27 — First Ship-Born Captain
Captain Torres, born aboard in Year 2, became the first ship-born Captain. Her appointment was seen as a turning point — the ship was no longer a refugee vessel but a self-sustaining society.

### Year 45 — The Silence
Long-range communications with Sol were lost, likely due to transmitter failure on the Earth end. The event, known as "The Silence," was psychologically devastating for Generation 1 survivors. A memorial service drew the largest gathering in ship history. The Returner faction briefly swelled but subsided when analysis showed turning back was physically impossible.

## Key Locations

- **The Bridge**: Forward-most compartment. Panoramic viewport (actually a reinforced sensor display). Command operations 24/7.
- **The Promenade**: Central deck corridor with shops, cafés, and the Arboretum. The social heart of the ship.
- **The Arboretum**: A pressurized garden with real trees, grass, and a small pond. The most coveted recreational space. Waiting lists for private time slots.
- **Engineering**: Aft section. Loud, hot, and vital. Engineers are respected but tend to develop an insular culture ("deck rats").
- **The Brig**: Rarely used for long-term confinement. The ship can't afford to lose productive members, so most crimes result in community service or restricted access rather than imprisonment.

## Open Questions for Future Development
- What cargo of cultural artifacts was brought? (Music, films, books, seeds, DNA banks)
- Are there pets aboard? (Likely some — cats for morale, possibly a ship's dog)
- What religions are practiced? (Likely a mix, with some syncretic ship-born spirituality)
- Is there a black market? (Almost certainly — limited luxury goods create scarcity)
- What happens to the dead? (Recycled — matter is precious — but with ceremony)
