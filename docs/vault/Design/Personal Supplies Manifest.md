## Summary: Total Personal Consumption Per Person

| Resource | Daily | Monthly | Annual |
|----------|-------|---------|--------|
| Food | 1.81 kg | 54.3 kg | 661 kg |
| Water (gross) | 9.0 L | 270 L | 3,285 L |
| Water (net loss) | 0.44 L | 13.2 L | 161 L |
| Oxygen | 0.90 kg | 27.0 kg | 329 kg |
| Hygiene supplies | 0.021 kg | 0.62 kg | 7.4 kg |
| Medical supplies | 0.001 kg | 0.042 kg | 0.5 kg |
| Clothing/textiles | — | — | 2.4 kg |
| **Total gross daily mass** | **~11.7 kg** | | |
| **Total net daily loss** | **~0.5 kg** | | |

> The closed-loop target is <5% net mass loss per cycle. At 0.5 kg/person/day net loss across 7,500 people, the ship loses ~1,369 metric tons/year — primarily trace minerals, worn materials, and process inefficiencies. This drives the need for the raw materials reserve and onboard synthesis capability.
