      "base_description": "A single square ceiling light panel fixture designed for spaceship interior ambient lighting. The fixture is 2 meters by 2 meters by 10 centimeters, designed to mount flush into ceiling grid systems. Front face is a translucent white acrylic diffuser panel that glows evenly when illuminated. Behind the diffuser is an LED array providing soft, shadow-free illumination at 5000K cool white color temperature. The panel has a subtle recessed frame (2cm wide) around the perimeter in brushed aluminum. Four corner mounting clips are visible but minimal. When powered, the entire panel glows uniformly without visible hotspots or individual LED points. Light output is diffuse and even, suitable for general room illumination. The fixture has a slight convex curve to the diffuser surface to prevent dust accumulation. Overall aesthetic is clean and modern, similar to office or laboratory ceiling fixtures but more refined (think Apple Store or modern hospital lighting). This should be rendered as a single complete light fixture showing both the glowing face (illuminated) and the frame/mounting details. Product photography style with soft glow effect to show it as an active light source, clean white background, centered composition.",

The fixture consists of a cylindrical housing (15cm diameter, 20cm long) in brushed aluminum or white powder coat finish. Front has a focusing lens (8cm diameter) with subtle ribbed texture. Housing mounts on a ball-joint swivel mechanism allowing 180-degree adjustment. Base mount is a circular plate (12cm diameter) with three visible mounting bolts. Interior contains high-CRI LED producing focused 4000K neutral white light with adjustable beam angle (15-45 degrees). Power cable runs through articulated arm to ceiling mount. When illuminated, creates a defined cone of light without harsh edges. Small indicator LED on base shows power status (dim blue). Overall aesthetic is functional and industrial-modern, similar to architect desk lamps or professional photography lights. This should be rendered as a single complete spotlight fixture showing the housing, lens, adjustment mechanism, and base clearly.

Front face has a translucent white acrylic diffuser strip covering the LED elements. Housing has a subtle L-shaped profile allowing it to mount in corners where walls meet ceiling or floor. Back has continuous mounting channel with clips every 50cm. LEDs inside produce warm 3500K light with even distribution along the entire length. End caps are rounded and finished to match housing. Very slim profile (only 5cm protrusion from wall). When illuminated, creates a continuous glowing line with no visible individual LED points. Power input at one end with minimal connector housing (5cm cube). Overall aesthetic is architectural and minimal, similar to modern building accent lighting or cove lighting systems.

Top has a small status indicator light (green when normal, flashing when active). Lens has radial ribbing pattern for wide light dispersion. During normal operation emits low-intensity red glow (0.3 intensity) for visibility. During emergencies increases to full brightness with optional pulsing. Back of housing shows battery compartment access panel with warning labels. Weatherproof rating indicated by rubber gasket around lens. Overall aesthetic is utilitarian and safety-focused, similar to industrial emergency lights or submarine alarm lights (think Alien or Das Boot emergency lighting).
